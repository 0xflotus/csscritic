{"name":"CSS critic","body":"CSS critic\r\n==========\r\n\r\nA lightweight framework for regression testing of Cascading Style Sheets.\r\n\r\nWatch the screencast to write your first test:\r\n\r\nhttp://youtu.be/AqQ2bNPtF60.\r\n\r\nHow it works\r\n------------\r\n\r\nCSS critic checks your current layout constantly against a reference image you have provided in the past. If your layout breaks (or simply changes - CSS critic can't tell) your tests fail.\r\n\r\n*Get started:*\r\n\r\n1. Create a `RegressionRunner.html` similar to the one under `example/` and put it with your code that is to be tested.\r\n\r\n2. Register your page under test via:\r\n\r\n        csscritic.compare(PUT_THE_PAGE_URL_HERE);\r\n\r\n3. Open the RegressionRunner.html in Firefox for the first time.\r\n\r\n4. Follow the hint and save the resulting image as future reference.\r\n\r\n5. Re-run the RegressionRunner.html and see your test passing. Congratulations.\r\n\r\n*What do I do if my test fails?*\r\n\r\n1. Have a look at the diff image and visually check what has changed.\r\n\r\n2. If the change is an unwanted one fix your CSS,\r\n\r\n3. If deliberate generate a new reference image.\r\n\r\nLimitations\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n- Currently works in Firefox only.\r\n- [Same-origin restrictions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Same_origin_policy_for_JavaScript) apply when sourcing files.\r\n","tagline":"A lightweight framework for regression testing of Cascading Style Sheets","google":"UA-6236243-13","note":"Don't delete this file!
